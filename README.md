# Wizarding Exchange
This project is a basic ecommerce website that accomplishes two goals. It familiarized me with creating and deploying
an ecommerce site and it provides a one stop shop for witches and wizards to get their magical goods. If only 
I recieved my Hogwarts letter I would have been able to take advantage of my own site.
